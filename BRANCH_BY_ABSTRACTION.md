# BRANCH BY ABSTRACTION

Is a set-piece technique to effect a 'longer to complete' change in the trunk. Say a developer (or a pair of developers), has a change that is going to take five days to complete.

There may be some aspect of repetition to the coding activities that makes it longer to complete. No matter, the change was predicted as being time-consuming, complex, destabilizing/disruptive to everyone else in the development team.

1. There are alos a lot of develoeprs already depending on the code that is subject of the 'longer to complete' change, and we do not want them to be slowed down in any way.

2. No commit pused to the shared repository should jeopardize the ability to go live.
